We in groups of 3 people developed a remake of the Donkey Kong game in 3D with the implementation of the backface culling algorithm while playing the game. The game is created totally in Unity 3D.
The game assets are downloaded from Unity Asset Store and some online resources from public websites.
The backface culling algorithm implemented to let the user choose to turn on or turn off the backface culling on the game scene.
While playing the game, the user can press keyboard ‘b’ to turn on the backface culling, keyboard ‘f’ to turn on front face culling or keyboard ‘o’ to turn off the culling.
